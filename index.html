          <li>The head element contains information about the webpage.</li>
          <li>The head element is a container for metadata.</li>
          <li>Meta lements contain information about the page that is used by the browser.</li>
          <li>The body element represent the visible content shown to the user.</li>
          <li>HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language, which gives the website its structure.</li>
          <li>The name of semantic elements describes their function and should be used as much as possible,
            to keep the code easy to read         
          </li>
          <li>Elements are a type of content on a webpage.</li>
          <li>HTML elements are case sensitive, whereas declerations are not.</li>
          <li>An HTML attribute defines additional information about an element, and
            are always defined in the opening tag.
          </li>
          <li>The head element contains the metadata, which the browser reads to understand the website.</li>
          <li>Title elements are extremely important for Search Engine Optimization (SEO)</li>
          <li>The meta element defines metadata such as the character set, descriptiom, keywords, author, and viewport.</li>
          <li>Metadata is data about data.</li>
          <li>The link element connects and external resource to the HTML element.</li>
          <li>The charset element sets the character encoding</li>
          <li>UTF-8 is backwards compatible with ASCII and the preferred encoding for e-mail and web pages.</li>
          <li>The http-equiv element sets an HTTP header for content.</li>
          <li>Elements nested inside other elements are called child elements.</li>
          <li>The element that holds the children is called the parent element.</li>
          <li>The body element defines the body of the document, which is visible to the user</li>
          <li>Everything that needs to be shown to the user must be in the body element.</li>
          <li>The div element creates a division in the page</li>
          <li>The span element creates an inline division</li>
          <li>An element refers to the entire element from opening tag to closing tag, whereas a tag refers only to what apperats inside the angle brackets.</li>
          <li>The p element represents a paragpraph or block of text.</li>
          <li>The ul element represents unordered list</li>
          <li>The ol element represents ordered list</li>
          <li>The li element represents list elements</li>
          <li>The a (anchor) element creates link to the same or other webpages.</li>
          <li>Header tags from h1 to h6, while h1 should only be used once on each page.</li>
          <li>The src attribute defines the location, or source of the image file.</li>
          <li>The alt attribute contains a text string that describes the appearance and functionality of the image.</li>
          <li>Alt text can also improve search engine rankings for the website.</li>
          <li>The section elements are semantic elements that define a section in a document that contains thematic content</li>

          <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
          <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>
          <li>A selector defines the element to which declerations will apply.</li>
          <li>Declerations contain two important components: property and value</li>
          <li>The margin property indicates how much space there is around the outside of an element.</li>
          <li>The padding property adds space around the content, inside an element.</li>
          <li>Increasing the padding value increases the size of the entire element.</li>
          <li>The * selector targets all elements visible on the page.</li>
          <li>Do No Repeat Yourself (DRY)</li>
          <li>The rel attribute in the link element specifies the relationship between the current document and the linked document resource.</li>
          <li>The href attribute in the link element specifies the URL of the external resource.</li>
          <li>href is using a relative path, meaning location is derived from the current location.</li>

          <li>A variable is a named container that allows us to store data in our code.</li>
          <li>Control flow refers to the order in which a computer executescode based on our instructions</li>
          <li>We can instruct a program to deviate from the normal linear flow of an application, if certain conditions are met</li>
          <li>We can use conditional statements and loops to control the order in which the code is executed.</li>
          <li>An array is useful for storing multiple items with different data types.</li>
          <li>An index defines the location of a data item in the array. JavaScript is 0-indexed. (start from 0)</li>
          <li>console refers to a test environment that checks the code.</li>
          <li>.log() will output whatever is inside the parentheis.</li>

          <li>The script element goes just before the closing body tag.</li>

            <li>The third statement allows the array to iterate over each item. (x++)</li>
          </ul>
          <li>To define a function, we use the function keywork, followed by the function name with parenthesis and the function block.</li>
